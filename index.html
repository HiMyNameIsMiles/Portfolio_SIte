        <h2>Calypso Logo</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="mainsection">
      <p>This piece was inspired by various logo designs that I found on Pinterest. The initial sketches for this project would have the letters in the logo close together rather than the letters have space. The idea for this piece was for a character that I also designed alongside this logo and would eventually become a part of the final piece today. The logo was also orginally going to have a big star behind it but that got scrapped for a more simplistic look with small stars placed next to the logo. Overall, I am happy with how it turned out.  </p>

      <div class="mainsection">
      <p>This piece was created in my Print Production class which was the project given to us after we finished another project that we did for the class. In the first stages of the cookbook spreads project we actually had to make someoneelses recipe. The pictures that I took are also on the cookbook spreads. For most of the project, it was mostly spent making sure our analysis of type was up to date. And to make sure that kerning of type, rags, and other typographic mistakes are not present. Also, the small details in the file like the flowers, were all done on Adobe Illutsrator with the pen tool.</p>

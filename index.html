				<p>This piece was inspired by various logo designs that I found on Pinterest. The initial sketches for this project would have the letters in the logo close together rather than the letters have space. The idea for this piece was for a character that I also designed alongside this logo and would eventually become a part of the final piece today. The logo was also orginally going to have a big star behind it but that got scrapped for a more simplistic look with small stars placed next to the logo. Overall, I am happy with how it turned out.</p>

				<p>This piece was created in my Print Production class which was the project given to us after we finished another project that we did for the class. In the first stages of the cookbook spreads project we actually had to make someoneelses recipe. The pictures that I took are also on the cookbook spreads. For most of the project, it was mostly spent making sure our analysis of type was up to date. And to make sure that kerning of type, rags, and other typographic mistakes are not present. Also, the small details in the file like the flowers, were all done on Adobe Illutsrator with the pen tool.</p>

				<p>This poster is actually a redesign of a type poster I designed in Typography I that I was not happy with so I changed it. I experimented more with color and played around with the unreadability of the typeface. I did not change the way the typeface looked for the top portion of the poster I actually just used the typeface the way it looks. And the bottom was just using the cool shapes the typeface has. Overall I was really proud with the end result of the redesigned poster.</p>

				<p>The Small But Beautiful book was designed in my first year of being at York College of Pennsylvania. I experimented heavily with type while designing my book, using any way I saw that would look aesthetically pleasing to the viewer while reading about what the font galgo condensed can and can not be used for. I used everything from glyphs, exclamations, and numbers to create something that I was really proud of. </p>

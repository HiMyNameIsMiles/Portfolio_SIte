          <p>This piece was inspired by various logo designs that I found on
            Pinterest. The initial sketches for this
            project would have the letters in the logo close together rather
            than the letters have space. The idea for this
            piece was for a character that I also designed alongside this logo
            and would eventually become a part of the
            final piece today. The logo was also orginally going to have a big
            star behind it but that got scrapped for a
            more simplistic look with small stars placed next to the logo.
            Overall, I am happy with how it turned out. </p>

            project given to us after we finished another
            project that we did for the class. In the first stages of the
            cookbook spreads project we actually had to make
            someoneelses recipe. The pictures that I took are also on the
            cookbook spreads. For most of the project, it was
            mostly spent making sure our analysis of type was up to date. And to
            make sure that kerning of type, rags, and
            other typographic mistakes are not present. Also, the small details
            in the file like the flowers, were all done
            on Adobe Illutsrator with the pen tool. </p>
